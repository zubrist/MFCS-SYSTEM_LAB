# Gram-Schmidt
The Gram-Schmidt process takes a set of linearly independent vectors and transforms them into a set of mutually orthogonal vectors, essentially creating an orthonormal basis that spans the same space as the original set of vectors; in simpler terms, it makes a group of vectors perpendicular to each other while maintaining the same underlying space they represent. 

## Key points about the Gram-Schmidt process:
- **Function**: It converts a set of linearly independent vectors into an orthonormal set.
- **Application**: Useful in various areas of mathematics, particularly linear algebra, where orthogonal vectors are often required for calculations.
- **How it works**: The process iteratively subtracts the projection of each vector onto the previously calculated orthogonal vectors, ensuring the resulting vector is orthogonal to all previous ones.
